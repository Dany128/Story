During my 2 years of Pr√©pa, I hadn't come across a physical equation whose right term represented a null state while the other part designated an agitated state. A state being represented by its mass or energy. 
What's more, equations are capable of showing both the temporal and spatial property of a state. The equation of thermal transfers is a perfect example as the variation of energy in time is directly linked to the spatial variation.
How come one believe a non null state appeared out of nothing (null state) after that ? Disproving in the process all laws that reign this universe. Isn't God the exception to these laws ? The only one who could transcend them ?
